# **School Management System (CLI)**  
### *Fusion Five Group Project*

We are incredibly proud to present the **School Management System**, a robust and dynamically implemented **CLI-based application** developed as a core academic project by the **Fusion Five Group**. This project was a labor of love, designed to simulate and manage the essential data and operations of a modern educational institution.

---

## **Features**

This system provides tailored access and control through dedicated portals, ensuring **data security** and **role-based functionality**.

---

## **Core Management (Admin Only)**

The heart of the system is a comprehensive management module, accessible exclusively to verified **Administrators**, allowing for dynamic control over institutional data.

The administrator can manage the following entities:

- **Student Data Management:** Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
- **Teacher Data Management:** Complete CRUD operations  
- **Admin User Management:** Complete CRUD operations  
- **Library Data Management:** Complete CRUD operations (managing books and resources)  
- **Search and View:** Functionality to search for specific records and view all data for any given entity  

---

## **Role-Based Portals**

The system ensures that each user type can only access their relevant information through dedicated portals:

- **Admin Portal:** Full access to all management features, including data manipulation and user management.  
- **Student Portal:** Enables enrolled students to securely view their personal data, academic records, and status.  
- **Teacher Portal:** Enables teachers to securely access their scheduled classes, assigned students, and personal profiles.

## **Technology Stack**

This project was built focusing on foundational programming principles, resulting in a clean, functional, and efficient **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application.

| **Technology** | **Description** |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Python** | The primary programming language used for building the application logic. |
| **Functional Programming** | Emphasized cleaner functions and immutable data operations. |
| **CLI Based** | The user interface is driven entirely through the Command Line Interface. |
| **JSON** | Used for persistent data storage, keeping all institutional records in structured JSON files. |
